Development began in 2021 and has been on hiatus since 2023.

## Roblox Platform

Roblox is a global platform that brings people together through game playing.
It is supported on various hardware platforms from mobile phone to PC, even
game consoles like Xboxes. The game developers and players form a vabriant
community. It is estimated that there are more than 9.5 million developers on
the platform. It is also a perfect platform for learning coding and game
development.

## Features

The game is currently playable with one course and one vehicle. There are
multiple strategic items that can be given by item boxes. WASD is used to
control the vehicle, while Space Bar is used to start a drift, similar to Mario
Kart.
